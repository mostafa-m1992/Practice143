practicing json/
a simple practice for showing some data in a listView by json/
I made item_list layout for placing data/
two model class: one for main data and one for phone data/
calling phone model in person model/
creating adapter by extending BaseAdapter/
create viewHolder class to hold data/
building object of each class in mainActivity/
using a Utils class/
getJson class for getting and sending data/
the sign of jsonObject is {...} and jsonArray is [â€¦]/
so we should make object of array or object for each one and calling data/
three methods in this class is necessary/
